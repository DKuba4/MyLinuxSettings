I've only ecountered this bug with my current laptop.
The way it works is the following, after doing an install of any linux
distribution, and booting into the installed linux, my system will go to
sleep, after hitting any kew it will wake up for 5 seconds and then go to
sleep again and so on.
I currently have no clue on why this happens, as the live enviroments work
completly fine.

The fix for this is quite simple, just before booting into the install,
either in the live enviroment or the chroot in case of no live enviroment,
you will have to modify the following file:
/etc/systemd/logind.conf

In this file you have to set anything that contains the word "lid" to ignore,
don't forget to uncomment the lines, after this you can boot the linux 
normally.
